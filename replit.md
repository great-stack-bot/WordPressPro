## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React plugin and development optimizations

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema management
- **Storage Implementation**: Dual approach with MemStorage for development and PostgreSQL for production
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based sessions using connect-pg-simple

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Posts Table**: Main content storage with title, excerpt, content, category, author info, and metadata
- **Comments Table**: User comments linked to posts with author details and engagement metrics
- **Subscribers Table**: Email newsletter subscription management
